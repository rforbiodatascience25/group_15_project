## Data and aim

Information and link to the data can be found here: <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mansoordaku/ckdisease>

The data was collected over 2 months in India, and includes a set of 25 physiological features of the individuals, as well as information on whether the individual has chronic kidney disease ("classification" in the original data).

In this project, we aim to identify if any of these 25 physiological features are correlated with and can predict the presence of chronic kidney disease in an individual.
